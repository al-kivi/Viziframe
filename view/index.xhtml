<h1>Welcome to our new website</h1>

<p>If you are a returning visit to our site, you will see many changes.</p>

<p>The first change you will see is a new layout that is a result of the move to Ramaze language.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Ramaze, you can find more information at <a href="http://ramaze.net">Ramaze web site</a>.</p>

<p>Another change that you will discover is the use of Google docs spreadsheets to store the results of the weekly production analysis.</p>

<p>The Google spreadsheets provide more capabilities including visitor mapping and additional pivot analysis.</p>

<p>Here is a sample map that is available with the Google tool.</p>
